	abstract = {The spread of infectious diseases can be unpredictable. With the emergence of antibiotic resistance and worrying new viruses, and with ambitious plans for global eradication of polio and the elimination of malaria, the stakes have never been higher. Anticipation and measurement of the multiple factors involved in infectious disease can be greatly assisted by mathematical methods. In particular, modeling techniques can help to compensate for imperfect knowledge, gathered from large populations and under difficult prevailing circumstances. Heesterbeek et al. review the development of mathematical models used in epidemiology and how these can be harnessed to develop successful control strategies and inform public health policy.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aaa4339 BACKGROUND Despite many notable successes in prevention and control, infectious diseases remain an enormous threat to human and animal health. The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales that span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or persist in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, human connectivity, population growth, urbanization, environmental and land-use change, as well as changing human behavior, present global challenges for prevention and control. Faced with this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools for understanding epidemiological patterns and for developing and evaluating evidence for decision-making in global health. ADVANCES During the past 50 years, the study of infectious disease dynamics has matured into a rich interdisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics, epidemiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, immunology, sociology, and public health. The practical challenges range from establishing appropriate data collection to managing increasingly large volumes of information. The theoretical challenges require fundamental study of many-layered, nonlinear systems in which infections evolve and spread and where key events can be governed by unpredictable pathogen biology or human behavior. In this Review, we start with an examination of real-time outbreak response using the West African Ebola epidemic as an example. Here, the challenges range from underreporting of cases and deaths, and missing information on the impact of control measures to understanding human responses. The possibility of future zoonoses tests our ability to detect anomalous outbreaks and to estimate human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover while also assessing the risk of more dangerous strains evolving. Increased understanding of the dynamics of infections in food webs and ecosystems where host and nonhost species interact is key. Simultaneous multispecies infections are increasingly recognized as a notable public health burden, yet our understanding of how different species of pathogens interact within hosts is rudimentary. Pathogen genomics has become an essential tool for drawing inferences about evolution and transmission and, here but also in general, heterogeneity is the major challenge. Methods that depart from simplistic assumptions about random mixing are yielding new insights into the dynamics of transmission and control. There is rapid growth in estimation of model parameters from mismatched or incomplete data, and in contrasting model output with real-world observations. New data streams on social connectivity and behavior are being used, and combining data collected from very different sources and scales presents important challenges. All these mathematical endeavors have the potential to feed into public health policy and, indeed, an increasingly wide range of models is being used to support infectious disease control, elimination, and eradication efforts. OUTLOOK Mathematical modeling has the potential to probe the apparently intractable complexity of infectious disease dynamics. Coupled to continuous dialogue between decision-makers and the multidisciplinary infectious disease community, and by drawing on new data streams, mathematical models can lay bare mechanisms of transmission and indicate new approaches to prevention and control that help to shape national and international public health policy. Modeling for public health. Policy questions define the model{\textquoteright}s purpose. Initial model design is based on current scientific understanding and the available relevant data. Model validation and fit to disease data may require further adaptation; sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can point to requirements for collection of additional specific data. Cycles of model testing and analysis thus lead to policy advice and improved scientific understanding. Despite some notable successes in the control of infectious diseases, transmissible pathogens still pose an enormous threat to human and animal health. The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales, which span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Moreover, some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or can survive in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge. In the face of this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools for synthesizing information to understand epidemiological patterns, and for developing quantitative evidence for decision-making in global health.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a dramatic loss of lives worldwide, challenging the sustainability of our health care systems, threatening economic meltdown, and putting pressure on the mental health of individuals (due to social distancing and lock-down measures). The pandemic is also posing severe challenges to the scientific community, with scholars under pressure to respond to policymakers&rsquo; demands for advice despite the absence of adequate, trusted data. Understanding the pandemic requires fine-grained data representing specific local conditions and the social reactions of individuals. While experts have built simulation models to estimate disease trajectories that may be enough to guide decision-makers to formulate policy measures to limit the epidemic, they do not cover the full behavioural and social complexity of societies under pandemic crisis. Modelling that has such a large potential impact upon people&rsquo;s lives is a great responsibility. This paper calls on the scientific community to improve the transparency, access, and rigour of their models. It also calls on stakeholders to improve the rapidity with which data from trusted sources are released to the community (in a fully responsible manner).  Responding to the pandemic is a stress test of our collaborative capacity and the social/economic value of research.},

	abstract = {Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAJK was supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society (grant Number 206250/Z/17/Z).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
